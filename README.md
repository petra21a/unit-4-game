## Assignment Challenge
In this challenge, our app had to dynamically update our HTML pages with the jQuery library. The Crystal Collector Game basic requirements were for the player to try and match a target value by adding up values associate with 4 randomly generated values.
## Technical Approach
- The challenges to this assignment was to dynamically update the html untilizing Listeners from the user. I emphasized the basic balance concept of this game, by challenging myself with css to vary a set of scales porportional to the value added. This was a time consuming but fun activity.
